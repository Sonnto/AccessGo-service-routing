# AccessGo: Service & Routing pages

## Details
Mobile rendering of AccessGo's high-fidelity mockup screens of "Service" and "Routing". AccessGo is a mobile application meant to make the lives of people with disabilities easier when doing every-day things, such as going to the grocery store. One discussed feature of the application is to help an individual create an accessibility-friendly route through a grocery store depending on items the customer picked to buy and their disability. This was a project between the cohorts in the Web Development, UX/UI, and Content Strategist programmes at Humber College.
